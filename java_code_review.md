Java Code Review Checklist
==========================

### Utilize this checklist to review the quality of your Java code, including security, performance, and static code analysis.

  

Clean Code
----------

**Checklist Item**

**Category**

Use Intention-Revealing Names

Meaningful Names

Pick one word per concept

Meaningful Names

Use Solution/Problem Domain Names

Meaningful Names

Classes should be small!

Classes

Functions should be small!

Functions

Do one Thing

Functions

Don't Repeat Yourself (Avoid Duplication)

Functions

Explain yourself in code

Comments

Make sure the code formatting is applied

Formatting

Use Exceptions rather than Return codes

Exceptions

Don't return Null

Exceptions

Security
--------

**Checklist Item**

**Category**

Make class final if not being used for inheritance

Fundamentals

Avoid duplication of code

Fundamentals

Restrict privileges: Application to run with the least privilege mode required for functioning

Fundamentals

Minimize the accessibility of classes and members

Fundamentals

Document security related information

Fundamentals

Input into a system should be checked for valid data size and range

Denial of Service

Avoid excessive logs for unusual behavior

Denial of Service

Release resources (Streams, Connections, etc) in all cases

Denial of Service

Purge sensitive information from exceptions (exposing file path, internals of the system, configuration)

Confidential Information

Do not log highly sensitive information

Confidential Information

Consider purging highly sensitive from memory after useÂ 

Confidential Information

Avoid dynamic SQL, use prepared statement

Injection Inclusion

Limit the accessibility of packages,classes, interfaces, methods, and fields

Accessibility Extensibility

Limit the extensibility of classes and methods (by making it final)

Accessibility Extensibility

Validate inputs (for valid data, size, range, boundary conditions, etc)

Input Validation

Validate output from untrusted objects as input

Input Validation

Define wrappers around native methods (not declare a native method public)

Input Validation

Treat output from untrusted object as input

Mutability

Make public static fields final (to avoid caller changing the value)

Mutability

Avoid exposing constructors of sensitive classes

Object Construction

Avoid serialization for security-sensitive classes

Serialization Deserialization

Guard sensitive data during serialization

Serialization Deserialization

Be careful caching results of potentially privileged operations

Serialization Deserialization

Only use JNI when necessary

Access Control

     * Reference: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html

Performance
-----------

**Checklist Item**

**Category**

Avoid excessive synchronization

Concurrency

Keep Synchronized Sections Small

Concurrency

Beware the performance of string concatenation

General Programming

Avoid creating unnecessary objects

Creating and Destroying Objects

    * Reference: http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/java/9780137150021

General
-------

**Category**

**Checklist Item**

Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors

Exceptions

Favor the use of standard exceptions

Exceptions

Don't ignore exceptions

Exceptions

Check parameters for validity

Methods

Return empty arrays or collections, not nulls

Methods

Minimize the accessibility of classes and members

Classes and Interfaces

In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields

Classes and Interfaces

Minimize the scope of local variables

General Programming

Refer to objects by their interfaces

General Programming

Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions

General Programming

Avoid finalizers

Creating and Destroying Objects

Always override hashCode when you override equals

General Programming

Always override toString

General Programming

Use enums instead of int constants

Enums and Annotations

Use marker interfaces to define types

Enums and Annotations

Synchronize access to shared mutable data

Concurrency

Prefer executors to tasks and threads

Concurrency

Document thread safety

Concurrency

Valid JUnit / JBehave test cases exist

Testing

Static Code Analysis
--------------------

**Category**

**Checklist Item**

Check static code analyzer report for the classes added/modified

Static Code Analysis

code style Java (programming language)
